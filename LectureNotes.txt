# CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users
# DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users

*** SQL Injection ***
SQL Injection attacks is when your programs are coded in such a way that users can execute any SQL code they want,
without accessing your database directly

# title, release_date, watched
# SELECT * FROM users WHERE surname LIKE 'Do%'
#    '%th' matches anything ending with `th`
#    'Do__s' matches anything starting with 'Do', ending with 's', and with two characters in between
#    'Bo%b' matches anything starting with 'Bo', ending with 'b', and any number of characters in between
#    '%sens%' matches anything containing 'sens', like 'sensibility' or 'insensible'


*** ACID ***
Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability
-- Atomicity: this means that transactions are indivisible, every operation must happen successfully, or none do
-- Consistency: The rules and constraints of the database are followed at all times. With foreign key constraints, you can't have
a foreign key pointing to a non-existing primary key value. There are more constraints such as UNIQUE or NOT NULL
-- Isolation: This means data is only visible in the database when the transaction has ended and committed.
-- Durability: This means that data is saved to permanent storage once a transaction is committed
